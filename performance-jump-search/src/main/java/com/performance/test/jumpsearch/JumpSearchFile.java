/*
 * This jump algorithm as described in:
 * http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2011/12/12/computer-algorithms-jump-search/
 * Tries to calculate first generic step jump in order to search
 * Unlike the binary search model, it assumes that is better to jump a step and then perform the already known binary search
 * As for this implementation it is being created without consideration on performance using an IJW (It just works) model
